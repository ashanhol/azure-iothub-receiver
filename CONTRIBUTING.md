# Contributing to azure-iothub-receiver

This project was created to supplement projects that connect to Azure IoT Hub 
using Node.js. If you have any feature requests or bugs, please feel free to
open an issue. If applicable, please have your Pull Requests reference the 
open issues it fixes. 

## I don't have a physical device

This project expects users to have physical devices they're connecting to 
Azure IoT Hub. If you are a contributor who wants to use a simulated device,
refer to the steps [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-node-node-getstarted#create-a-simulated-device-app) 
It's useful to read through the full guide as it steps through setting up a full
project, including setting up an Azure IoT Hub. You may notice that the step
that has you create **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** serves a similar function
to this module.
